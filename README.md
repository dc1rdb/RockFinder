# RockFinder
Scintillator based detector for radioactive minerals

This is an add-on for Nuclear Phoenix' Mini SiPM Driver (SiD) Board https://github.com/OpenGammaProject/Mini-SiD

When looking for radioactive rocks in the wild, I always found it annoying to keep my eyes on the display of whatever gamma detector I was using. Concentrating on small changes in click rate is also less than ideal.
On the other hand, the human brain / ear can easily and subconciously detect very small variations in tone pitch.
With a few additional passive components, the Trigger/TTL output of the Mini SiD is hooked up to an ESP 8266 programmed as a voltage controlled oscillator.
